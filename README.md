# 04_BattleTank
An open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in UE4

## Game Design Document

### Concept:

Battle Tanks will be an open world PvE taking place in a mountainous terrain. There will be a handful of AI tanks that you will have to compete against. The winning condition is if you are the last tank standing on the map.

### Rules:

* Each tank will have finite ammunition
* Each tank will have an initial HP of 140
* The top speed of the tank will be capped to 50 km/h
* The Caliber will damage the HP of either side by 20
* When HP = 0, the tank will blow up in a spectacular explosion
* When HP < 30, the tank can only travel at a slower speed as a result of the damage it took.

### Requirements:

* A mountainous terrain with trees, foliage, and a lake (I will be using free assets for this)
* Mouse and Keyboard controls and (maybe) an option for joypad support
* A simple tank model
* Sound FX such as explosions, gun firing, tank engine sound when moving
* Background music for main menu and main gameplay
